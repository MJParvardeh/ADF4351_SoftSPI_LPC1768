# ADF4351_SoftSPI_LPC1768
easy to use code for manipulating ADF4351 with software spi interface.
you can use register parameters (based on ADF4351 datasheet) with defined structures in adf4351.h
you can use register values to set frequency (use ADF4351 software to generate frequency table) with ADF4351_DirectSet function.
you can use SetPLLFREQ function to generate frequency without deep knowledge about adf4351 register parameters.
